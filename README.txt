This is a small utility that converts colored images into a reduced version. Bascially it hass three features: 

a. Reduce the number of colors in a image to specified number. For example if you want to have images with only 16 colors you can specifiy this, 
and the algorithm will select the best 16 colors form the existing colors as to preserve the original aspect. 
b. You can tutn the images into non color images, so for instance instead of having only 16 different colors you can have 16 gray shades. 
c. You can also resample the images to a specified value . You specifiy a number between 1 and 99 
( for instance 75 means the width and height will 75% of the original size). 
d. The images contained into the specified folder ( please provide the full path ) would be copied into a folder named Reduced and transformed according to settings 
( scaled, reduce colors .. )
